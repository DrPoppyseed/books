### Desires

I want to go through the collection of works by Dostoyevsky.
I also want to go through the 150 essential reads introduced in `必読書150`...

## Read, or Currently Reading

- [ ] **The Origins of Totalitarianism** by Hannah Arendt

- [x] **A Philosophy of Software Design** by John Ousterhout

> The greatest limitation in writing software is our ability to understand the
> systems we are creating. (p1)

> One of the most important goals of good design is for a system to be *obvious*
> . (p9)

> Complexity isn't caused by a single catastrophic error; it accumulates in lots
> of small chunks. (p11)

> The best modules are those whose interfaces are much simpler than their
> implementations. Such modules have two advantages. First , a simple interface
> minimizes the complexity that a module imposes on the rest of the system.
> Second, if a module is modified in a way that does not change its interface,
> then no other module will be affected by the modification. (p20)

> The most important issue in designing classes and other modules is to make
> them deep, so that they have simple interfaces for the common use cases, yet
> still provide significant functionality. (p27)

> The interface of a class should normally different from its implementation:
> the representations used internally should be different from the abstractions
> that appear in the interface. If the two have similar abstractions, then the
> class probably isn't very deep. (p50)

> When developing a module, look for opportunities to take a little bit of extra
> suffering upon yourself in order to reduce the suffering of your users. (p58)

> When deciding whether to combine or separate, the goal is to reduce the
> complexity of the system as a whole and improve its modularity.
> - Separation makes it harder for developers to see the components at the same
    time.
> - If there are dependencies between the components, then separation is bad.
> - Bring together if information is shared.
> - Bring together if it will simplify the interface.
> - Bring together to eliminate duplication. (p59-63)

> The way to separate special-purpose code from general-purpose code is to pull
> the special-purpose code upwards, into the higher layers, leaving the lower
> layers general-purpose. (p64)

> Comments are fundamental to abstractions. The goal of abstractions is to hide
> complexity: an abstraction is a simplified view of an entity, which preserves
> essential information but omits details that can safely be ignored. If users
> must read the code of a method in order to use it, then there is no
> abstraction:
> all of the complexity of the method is exposed. (p97)

> The overall idea behind comments is to capture information that was in the
> mind of the designer but couldn't be represented in the code. (p98)

> If interface comments must also describe the implementation, then the class or
> method is shallow. (p110)

> Software should be designed for ease of reading, not ease of writing. (p149) 

- [ ] **Crafting Interpreters** by Robert Nystrom

Because I want try writing my own language.

Currently reading

- [x] **Bloodlands** by Timothy Snyder

I picked this book up in light of the recent war in Ukraine, to better
understand what happened before and during the Second World War. I never
knew much about Ukraine outside its coverage during the impeachment trials
of Trump, so I figured it would give me some historical context to the
current situation.

- [x] **Embracing Defeat** by John Dower

This has been a long and hard read (a new word I didn't previously know pops
up almost every page) but a fruitful one nonetheless. It goes through the
complicated and nuanced state of postwar Japan, going through amazing detail
on how the Japanese people came to terms (and didn't come to terms) with the
Second World War, and GHQ's involvement in rebuilding a nation from its ashes.
It also examines the many contradictions that came up during the GHQ's rule.

### 2021

A slow year for books. I hardly read any and made me rethink how important it is
personally to read more regularly.

- [ ] **Design Patterns** by Gamma, Helm, Johnson, and Vlissides

I began reading this book in conjunction with Clean Architecture. It has
helped immensely in giving me the vocabulary to think about and describe to
others the architectures that I think would work good for certain projects.
The status is still `reading` because I've only read portions of the book
at the moment.

- [ ] **Refactoring** by Martin Fowler

I've been borrowing a lot of ideas introduced in the book (especially
`Replace Temp with Query (178)` and `Extract Function (106)`) at my day job
refactoring legacy code, but have yet to finish going through the entire book.

- [x] **Clean Architecture** by Robert C. Martin

This gave me the broad picture of what goals to strive for when thinking
about software architecture.

- [x] **戦後の昭和史** by 半藤一利

A good refresher, told in an easy-to-read, narrative driven format, covering
the history of Japan leading up to and during the Second World War.

### 2020, Winter

- [x] **Shoe Dog** by Phil Knight

A short read with episodes of adventures and overcoming hardships throughout
the years leading up to and during the run of the Nike brand.

- [x] **Black Box Thinking** by Matthew Syed

A good book full of case studies on the different instances in which taking
data effectively illuminates problems where there seemed none, and
facilitates a fertile foundation of improvement.

- [x] **How Fascism Works** by Jason Stanley

The book gave me a good overview of how fascism works, and the tactics commonly
utilized in strongman politics.

- [x] **民衆暴力・一揆・暴動・虐殺の日本近代** by 藤野裕子

Throughout the majority of the book, the author describes the many democratic,
largely nonviolent protests by farmers against the local governments that took
place actively during the Edo period. However, the book left a lasting
impression in its final chapters, where the author covers the atrocities
committed against the Korean immigrant population after the Great Kanto
Earthquake of 1923.

The book was certainly an interesting and at time, gut-wrenching read.
