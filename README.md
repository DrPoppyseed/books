## Read, or Currently Reading

- [ ] **The Origins of Totalitarianism** by Hannah Arendt

- [x] **The Launch Pad** by Randall Stross

> "Here's how to generate new ideas. Three things. One: founders are target 
> users. Two: not many people could build it, but founders are among them. Three:
> few people realize it is a big deal." (p68)

> "Ask yourself: 'What do I wish someone would start a startup to do for me?'" 
> says Graham. "The next best thing: something for someone else that you know is 
> a problem." (p69)

> Paul Graham is fond of a Silicon Valley saying: "You make what you measure."
> The act of measuring some aspect of perfomance leads to caring about that one 
> thing and lavishing your attention on it, which, in turn, leads to improving it.
> He suggests that startups set a specific weekly target for rowth, which can be
> measured in terms of revenue or users or something else, but should be essential
> to the startup. Anything that is not directly related to that metric is to be 
> pushed to the wayside. (p78)

> "I noticed," Graham says, "looking down the rankings -at least my rankings- that
> all the ones at the top were, like, real animals at doing sales." He does not 
> mean to say that strength in sales was all that was needed. "You have to be good 
> at hacking *and* be aggressive in sales. Everybody we fund is good at hacking. 
> We can tell *that*!" What the YC partners might have missed is that willingness 
> to attack sales. "When I say sales, I don't just mean going out and talking to 
> customers to figure out what they want. So why don't you try this: erring on 
> the side of sales. Just spend all your time doing sales and treating hacking as 
> this side project, right?" The outrageousness of his suggestion makes Graham 
> more animated. "*That*-" He pauses for emphasis. "*That* will tend to produce
> really good results." (p120)

> ...the basic YC tenets: work on code and talk with customers; launch fast and 
> iterate; focus on one measurable weekly goal. (p150)

> One: you really need a huge market. And two: you need founder-market fit.
> (p230)

> "Just focus on one of three things: One, be cheaper. Two, focus on a niche.
> Or, three, be 10x better than the other products out there." (p231)

> One. You've got to put yourself out there and meet people, even if it's 
> awkward. Two, You've got to hug your cofounders and love your batchmates.
> Three. Experts aren't going to help you solve your problems. Four. You've 
> gotta have swag." (p236)

- [x] **A Philosophy of Software Design** by John Ousterhout

> The greatest limitation in writing software is our ability to understand the
> systems we are creating. (p1)

> One of the most important goals of good design is for a system to be *obvious*
> . (p9)

> Complexity isn't caused by a single catastrophic error; it accumulates in lots
> of small chunks. (p11)

> The best modules are those whose interfaces are much simpler than their
> implementations. Such modules have two advantages. First , a simple interface
> minimizes the complexity that a module imposes on the rest of the system.
> Second, if a module is modified in a way that does not change its interface,
> then no other module will be affected by the modification. (p20)

> The most important issue in designing classes and other modules is to make
> them deep, so that they have simple interfaces for the common use cases, yet
> still provide significant functionality. (p27)

> The interface of a class should normally different from its implementation:
> the representations used internally should be different from the abstractions
> that appear in the interface. If the two have similar abstractions, then the
> class probably isn't very deep. (p50)

> When developing a module, look for opportunities to take a little bit of extra
> suffering upon yourself in order to reduce the suffering of your users. (p58)

> When deciding whether to combine or separate, the goal is to reduce the
> complexity of the system as a whole and improve its modularity.
> - Separation makes it harder for developers to see the components at the same
    time.
> - If there are dependencies between the components, then separation is bad.
> - Bring together if information is shared.
> - Bring together if it will simplify the interface.
> - Bring together to eliminate duplication. (p59-63)

> The way to separate special-purpose code from general-purpose code is to pull
> the special-purpose code upwards, into the higher layers, leaving the lower
> layers general-purpose. (p64)

> Comments are fundamental to abstractions. The goal of abstractions is to hide
> complexity: an abstraction is a simplified view of an entity, which preserves
> essential information but omits details that can safely be ignored. If users
> must read the code of a method in order to use it, then there is no
> abstraction:
> all of the complexity of the method is exposed. (p97)

> The overall idea behind comments is to capture information that was in the
> mind of the designer but couldn't be represented in the code. (p98)

> If interface comments must also describe the implementation, then the class or
> method is shallow. (p110)

> Software should be designed for ease of reading, not ease of writing. (p149) 

- [ ] **Crafting Interpreters** by Robert Nystrom

Because I want try writing my own language.

Currently reading

- [x] **Bloodlands** by Timothy Snyder

I picked this book up in light of the recent war in Ukraine, to better
understand what happened before and during the Second World War. I never
knew much about Ukraine outside its coverage during the impeachment trials
of Trump, so I figured it would give me some historical context to the
current situation.

> Ideology, when stripped by time or partisanship of its political and economic
> connections, becomes a moralizing form of explanation for mass killing, one 
> that comfortably separates the people who explain from the people who kill.
> (p399)

> No major war or act of mass killing in the twentieth century began without 
> the aggressors or perpetrators first claiming innocence and victimhood. In
> the twenty-first century, we see a second wave of aggressive wars with victim 
> claims, in which leaders not only present their peoples as victims but make 
> explicit claims, in which leaders not only present their peoples as victims
> but make explicit reference to the mass murders of the twentieth century.
> The human capacity for subjective victimhood is apparently limitless, and 
> people who believe that they are victims can be motivated to perform acts
> of great violence. (p400)

> It is less appealing, but morally more urgent, to understand the actions 
> of the perpetrators. The moral danger, after all, is never that one might 
> become a victim but that one might be perpetrator or a bystander. (p400)

> People who called others subhuman were themselves subhuman. Yet to deny a
> human being his human character is to render ethics impossible. (p400)

> To dismiss the Nazis or the Soviets as beyond human concern or historical
> understanding is to fall into their moral trap. The safer route is to 
> realize that their motives for killing, however revolting to us, made sense
> to them. (p400)

> To believe that vast suffering must be associated with great progress is to
> accept a kind of hermetic masochism: the presence of pain is a sign of some 
> immanent or emergent good. To advance this sort of reasoning oneself is
> hermetic sadism: if I caused pain, it was because there was a higher
> purpose, known to me. (p401)


- [x] **Embracing Defeat** by John Dower

This has been a long and hard read (a new word I didn't previously know pops
up almost every page) but a fruitful one nonetheless. It goes through the
complicated and nuanced state of postwar Japan, going through amazing detail
on how the Japanese people came to terms (and didn't come to terms) with the
Second World War, and GHQ's involvement in rebuilding a nation from its ashes.
It also examines the many contradictions that came up during the GHQ's rule.

### 2021

A slow year for books. I hardly read any and made me rethink how important it is
personally to read more regularly.

- [ ] **Design Patterns** by Gamma, Helm, Johnson, and Vlissides

I began reading this book in conjunction with Clean Architecture. It has
helped immensely in giving me the vocabulary to think about and describe to
others the architectures that I think would work good for certain projects.
The status is still `reading` because I've only read portions of the book
at the moment.

- [ ] **Refactoring** by Martin Fowler

I've been borrowing a lot of ideas introduced in the book (especially
`Replace Temp with Query (178)` and `Extract Function (106)`) at my day job
refactoring legacy code, but have yet to finish going through the entire book.

- [x] **Clean Architecture** by Robert C. Martin

This gave me the broad picture of what goals to strive for when thinking
about software architecture.

- [x] **戦後の昭和史** by 半藤一利

A good refresher, told in an easy-to-read, narrative driven format, covering
the history of Japan leading up to and during the Second World War.

### 2020, Winter

- [x] **Shoe Dog** by Phil Knight

A short read with episodes of adventures and overcoming hardships throughout
the years leading up to and during the run of the Nike brand.

- [x] **Black Box Thinking** by Matthew Syed

A good book full of case studies on the different instances in which taking
data effectively illuminates problems where there seemed none, and
facilitates a fertile foundation of improvement.

- [x] **How Fascism Works** by Jason Stanley

The book gave me a good overview of how fascism works, and the tactics commonly
utilized in strongman politics.

- [x] **民衆暴力・一揆・暴動・虐殺の日本近代** by 藤野裕子

Throughout the majority of the book, the author describes the many democratic,
largely nonviolent protests by farmers against the local governments that took
place actively during the Edo period. However, the book left a lasting
impression in its final chapters, where the author covers the atrocities
committed against the Korean immigrant population after the Great Kanto
Earthquake of 1923.

The book was certainly an interesting and at time, gut-wrenching read.
